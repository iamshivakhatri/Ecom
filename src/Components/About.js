          <p>Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Ujjwal Adhikari, 
            and I'm a passionate artist who loves to draw and paint. I'm currently a student 
            at Howard University, pursuing my academic interests while simultaneously developing
            my artistic talents. Originally from Nepal, I've always been inspired by the rich 
            cultural heritage of my homeland, and I try to incorporate those influences into my
            art whenever possible. For me, art is a way to connect with others, to express myself,
            and to explore the world around me. I believe that everyone has the capacity to appreciate
            art, and I'm excited to share my work with you. Thank you for visiting my website, and 
            I hope you enjoy my paintings!
